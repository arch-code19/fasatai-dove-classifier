# fasatai-dove-classifier
This project is based on the second chapter of the FastAI book at https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/02_production.ipynb.
A dove species classifier Computer Vision model was created based on resnet50 and trained on images of mourning doves, rock doves and zebra doves.
